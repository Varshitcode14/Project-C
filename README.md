# Project-C
AI driven crop disease prediction system 

<p1> We divide the project intially into 3 folders frontend,backend and instance </p1> 

frontend :
react js /vite (for the connection to flask backend) 

backend :
Flask / python backend environment 

databases used : 
3 main datasets main purpose of training the model for the prediction 


         ML part : 
               possibilty 1) CNN for identification of disease 
               possiblity 2) ViT(visuall transformers)

               preference -- > possibilty 2) 


          Betterment chances : 
               LLMs usage (generative AI) : for the purpose of report generation 

               mishap over here:   connecting LLM model and then using embedding api  further more technical diffculties 
                                   paid subscription of OPENAI (too high for temporary purposes ) -->affordabilty issues 

               other alternative:
                we can use clusstering algorithm for finding the best solution  (most nearest vector) 

                mishap over here : insuffecient data (only choice to take datasets for all given disease pre-maintained solutions ) huge numbber  of solutons required 


        Scope further : 
              platform creation for resolvers and problem seekers
